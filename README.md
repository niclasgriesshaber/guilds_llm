# LLM Digitization and Analysis of Archival Documents

This repository contains code and data for digitizing Latin American guild ordinances and classifying their sentences into economic categories using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Getting Started Quickly (For Economic Historians)

This repository is primarily composed of Jupyter notebooks designed for economic historians interested in quantitative analysis of historical guild regulations. You do **not** need strong technical skills to get started.

**Fastest way to get started:**
- Download and install a modern IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com/en).
- Open the IDE and enter "Agent Mode" (in Cursor, press `Cmd + L`).
- Ask the agent to **clone this repository** and set it up for you. For example, you can write: `Clone https://github.com/niclasgriesshaber/guilds-llm and set it up.`
- The agent will handle the setup, so you can immediately start exploring the notebooks.

You can also explain to the Agent what changes you want to make and put your own data into the project. You can then quickly adjust this repository for your needs.

**Note:** To access GPT-4o for LLM-based analysis, you will need an OpenAI API key. You can generate one at [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). The API key must be inserted in one of the code cells (prior to any LLM API calls) in the Jupyter notebooks. All relevant cells are clearly commented to guide you through this process. Alternatively, you can also create an .env file to store your API keys there.
